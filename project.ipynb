    "When given the ability of choice, people nearly always seeks out the best possible selection to ensure their own success. So, it is not surprising that students at the University of Maryland, College Park commonly compare course ratings and grade data, amongst many other factors, in their choice of which courses and course sections to select each semester. In this project, our group seeks to better understand the relationships between professor rating and professor average GPA with how students seek to enroll in courses within the Department of Computer Science at the UMCP.\n",

    "# Fetching Our Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we are able to begin our analysis, we first need to retrieve the publicly available data about professors and courses within the Computer Science Department. Using APIs developed by our peer students at the University hosted on `umd.io` and `planetterp.com`, we are able to secure the necessary data to conduct our analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetching large amounts of data from the `umd.io` and `planetterp.com` APIs consistently as we were working on our project turned out to be costly both in terms of the amount of time we were waiting for data to process, and costly for the APIs themselves, with us sometimes being rate-limited when fixing small mistakes. For reference, being rate-limited is when too many requests are sent to a public API, and the API limits requests from your address in an effort to conserve resources for others. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve the costliness of fetching and re-fetching the data from these publicly available APIs, we instead fetch all of the data about CMSC (Dept. of Computer Science) courses at UMCP at the beginning of our project, store them in an SQLite database, and use this database to do necessary queries throughout our data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the SQLite database over other initial solutions like MongoDB due to SQLite having native support in the Pandas library, along with the fact that storing our data in a table-like fashion made the most sense considering Pandas needs to represent it as a table as well. If we were to use MongoDB for example, we would need to query the database and then flatten our data to be placed into a Pandas dataframe for analysis anyways. By representing the data as a table from the beginning, we remove this rather redundant step when importing our data. Furthermore, keeping the data local in our own repository was also another plus, as needing to connect to a remote service for hosting our data could involve extra costs and complexity in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code that scrapes the `umd.io` and `planetterp.com` APIs and stores the necessary data that we recieve in our local SQLite database.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we need to get a list of all of the courses that are available within the `umd.io` API for us to fetch. However, we cannot get all of our data in one API request because:\n",
    "1. The API returns results in a paginated form, and we can only request up to 100 entries on each page. So, if there are more courses than 100 for a single set of request parameters, we need to keep fetching the next page until there are no more results to return.\n",
    "2. The API is supposed to support being able to request all courses less than or equal to (`leq`) than a semester, but the API seems to be broken and does not accept strings longer than six characters. To provide the `leq` option, we would need to provide `202008|leq` for the semester parameter, which is 10 characters long. To work around this issue, we start at the current year (`2022`) and iteratively make a call for both the spring `01` semester and `08` fall semesters for each year, decrementing the year each iteration.
